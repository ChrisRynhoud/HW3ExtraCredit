      <p>But Minecraft wasnt always this advanced. In its alpha stage minecraft wasnt even 3d.</p>

      <p>It was only through the creative genius of the game's original creator a swedish programmer commonly known as, Notch, and his later team that have helped minecraft grow to where it is today.</p>

      <p>However, in 2014 Minecraft was purchased by Microsoft for a whopping $2.5 Billion Dollars USD! Now thats a lot of money, huh?</p>

       <p>Microsoft has now expanded the Minecraft brand by creating more videogames that take place in the Minecraft universe such as Minecraft Dungeons which came out in 2020 and Minecraft Legends which comes out next year in 2023.</p>
